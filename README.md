# FortuneTellerMadlib
A .NET Core Application framework-dependent deployment (FDD) simple console application ("framework": {"name": "Microsoft.NETCore.App", "version": "1.1.2")} that can run on one of many .NET core platforms (Windows, OSX, Linux). FYI: This was done in a day and I did not implement some features like exception handling by choice.  A short but fun game that ask you for words that later describe wacky madlibs that output your fortune based on you choosing a number or random
